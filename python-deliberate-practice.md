# Python Deliberate Practice

## Performance Outcomes
The over-arching goal is to build a reputation of reliability & quality by improving my [software development skills](http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html) for data science. 

To achieve a higher bar in quality, this includes: 

**1. Write elegant, production-level python code**: Write read-able code that's clean, modular and re-usable. Elegant code should follow PEP8 standards and be using the best python practices. Cleanliness will also reduce the number of errors and make others' lives easier. 

**2. Reduce the number of errors by incorporating defensive programming**: Defensive programming include asserts, logging, and unit tests. This is important because producing error-free analysis is what will build trust with partners while opening up more opportunities for future projects. 

**3. Accelerate code speed**: Improving code speed will be broken down into a few components:
- Solving problems quickly 
- Distributed Computing
- Understanding different runtimes 

## Project Outcomes 

## Skill De-Construction 
#### 1. Clean, Pythonic Code [11/3 to 11/10]
Key here will be to remove bad habits from my programming, make my code legible and easy to understand. 

Resources:
- [Clean Python - Chapter 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1788996666?aaxitk=O0D8QewWcjJgRm12H9gWAw&pd_rd_i=1788996666&pf_rd_p=44fc3e0f-4b9e-4ed8-b33b-363a7257163d&hsa_cr_id=4159268800601&sb-ci-n=asinImage&sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fm.media-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F71aUCNW6ONL.jpg&sb-ci-a=1788996666)

Method of Learning/Training:
1. Read Clean Python + Clean Code in Jupyter Notebooks [20 minutes]
2. Code Review + Rewrite code in at least one notebook according to PEP8 style [20 minutes] 
3. Active Recall on prior concepts [20 minutes] 
4. Commit code to Github [1 minute] 

Specific Outcome: Write a blog post detailing best practices for writing clean python code. 

<p>

**2. Writing Better Functions/Classes [11/10 to 11/17]** - Improve the quality, effectiveness of the functions, classes I write. 

Resources: 
- [Clean Python - Chapter 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1788996666?aaxitk=O0D8QewWcjJgRm12H9gWAw&pd_rd_i=1788996666&pf_rd_p=44fc3e0f-4b9e-4ed8-b33b-363a7257163d&hsa_cr_id=4159268800601&sb-ci-n=asinImage&sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fm.media-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F71aUCNW6ONL.jpg&sb-ci-a=1788996666)

- [Sci-Kit Learn Source code](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/master/sklearn)

Method of Learning
1. Read Clean Python - Ch. 3/Read Sci-Kit Learn Source Code [20 minutes] 
2. Rewrite code in at least one script/notebook according to rules learned [20 minutes] 
3. Active Recall on prior concepts [20 minutes] 
4. Commit code to Github [1 minute] 

Specific Outcome - Read Clean Python + Active Recall on concepts by writing my own program.

<p>

**3. Debugging/Testing in Python[11/17 to 11/24]** - Key here will be to reduce the number of errors in my code. 

Resources:
- [Clean Python - Chapter 6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1788996666?aaxitk=O0D8QewWcjJgRm12H9gWAw&pd_rd_i=1788996666&pf_rd_p=44fc3e0f-4b9e-4ed8-b33b-363a7257163d&hsa_cr_id=4159268800601&sb-ci-n=asinImage&sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fm.media-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F71aUCNW6ONL.jpg&sb-ci-a=1788996666)

- [How to Conduct Code Reviews](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html)

Method of Learning
1. Read Clean Python - Debugging/Testing or Read Scikit Learn Test Cases 
2. Write test cases for at least one previously written function [20 minutes]
3. Commit my code to Github 

Specific Outcome - Write Unit Tests for Interpretability class 

**4. Project - Productionize Interpretability Class or write Diff-in-Diff Library [11/24 to 11/31]** - Interpretability Class is already written. Re-writing dash_ml will likely be too much to take on. However, improving upon the interpretability class will allow me to apply everything learned in the prior three weeks. It'll also force me to get feedback from co-workers. 

**5. Distributed Computing [11/31 to 12/31]** - Note: This is subject to change. The purpose here is to understand how to significantly accelerate the speed of my code. This can include:
- PySpark
- Pandas UDF's

*Specific Outcome* - Build an end to end ML pipeline using PySpark or Spark

## Scheduling 

![schedule_1](/img/schedule_1.png)

Key decisions:
- Will I do this in the morning or at night? **Morning**
- If I do it in the morning, when/how will I commute to work? **boosted board or scooter**. this would significantly reduce my commute to about 15 minutes. 

## Test Week [11/3 to 11/10] - Pythonic Code 
- Reevaluate on 11/10 on effectiveness of this plan.
