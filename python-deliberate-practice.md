# Python Deliberate Practice

## Performance Outcomes
Now that I've identified the gaps, I'll need to translate these into performance-based outcomes:

**1. Write high-quality, production-level python code**

**2. Reduce the number of errors by incorporating defensive programming**: Defensive programming include asserts, logging, and unit tests. This is important because producing error-free analysis is what will build trust with partners while opening up more opportunities for future projects. 

**3. Accelerate code speed**: Improving code speed will be broken down into a few components:
- Get better at translating logic into code 
- Understanding different Python runtimes under the hood
- Distributed Computing

### Influence/Leadership/Independence
**3. Decide on the business area of focus**: This will require more thinking & experimentation. 

## Project Outcomes 

## Skill De-Construction 
**1. Clean, Pythonic Code [11/3 to 11/10]** - Key here will be to remove bad habits from my programming, make my code legible and easy to understand.

*Method of Learning/Training*: 
1. Read Clean Python
2. Active Recall on concepts by creating my own examples for blog post

*Specific Outcome:* Write a blog post detailing best practices for writing clean python code. 

**2. Writing Better Functions/Classes [11/10 to 11/17]** - Improve the quality, effectiveness of the functions, classes I write.

*Method of Learning*
1. Read Clean Python - Ch. 3/Read Sci-Kit Learn Source Code 
2. Project Euler Problems 
3. Commit my code to Github

*Specific Outcome* - Read Clean Python + Active Recall on concepts by writing my own program.

**3. Debugging/Testing in Python[11/17 to 11/24]** - Key here will be to reduce the number of errors in my code.

*Method of Learning*
1. Read Clean Python - Debugging/Testing or Read Scikit Learn Test Cases 
2. Project Euler Problems 
3. Commit my code to Github 

*Specific Outcome* - Write Unit Tests for Interpretability class 

**4. Project - Productionize Interpretability Class [11/24 to 11/31]** - Interpretability Class is already written. Re-writing dash_ml will likely be too much to take on. However, improving upon the interpretability class will allow me to apply everything learned in the prior three weeks. It'll also force me to get feedback from co-workers. 

**5. Distributed Computing [11/31 to 12/31]** - Note: This is subject to change. The purpose here is to understand how to significantly accelerate the speed of my code. This can include:
- PySpark
- Pandas UDF's

*Specific Outcome* - Build an end to end ML pipeline using PySpark or Spark

## Scheduling 
- How I plan to integrate these into my schedule 

## Test Week [11/3 to 11/10]
Pythonic Code - Will stress test this plan for the first section on Pythonic Code. After the first week, we'll re-evaluate the effectiveness of the current schedule.
